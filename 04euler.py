Largest palindrome product
Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""
# largest possible number to use is 999
# therefore largest possible 3 digit product (start) is: (999**2)(998,001)
# smallest possible 2 digit product(end) is (100**2) (10,000)
# so, try factoring all palindromes between those endpoints

# 1) Find reverse of string - start with largest?
# 2) Check if reverse and original are same or not.
# 3) then select largest non-prime palindrome
